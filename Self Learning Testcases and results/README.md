Demonstration of a specific testing activity not taught in class.


The idea is that you will pick an area of testing you are interested in, and then learn about it and create a way to test it. So for example, if you are interested in security testing, load testing, ADA testing, database testing, or some other testing, then you choose one, then figure out how to construct tests to show you understand the type of testing you are doing, the test cases you used to "explore" that type of testing, and then your findings (and you will present to class as part of the oral presentation). Functional testing in and of itself doesn't count, since that is what you are effectively doing in the rest of the required test cases. If you want to learn a tool, then it should bring a specific type of testing to the picture (for example ZAP for security testing); Learning a tool to do alternate functional testing wont cut it unless there is a new angle to be explored. This is intended to be significantly (as in meaningful) NEW testing with its own test cases (a few at least) to explore the topic beyond the 10 required testcases (which are then broken into GUI, API, Automated, etc).  

A video you can show in class during your presentation is recommended. Limit to a few minutes max.  Slides are also ok.

This directory should contain the test cases and results, any screenshots or videos. You should treat this as if you are trying to teach or help others learn this testing activity, at least from a high level.
