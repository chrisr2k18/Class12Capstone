Your automation code will live here. You should include directions on how to run the code as well as the code and your test results. Assume I do not have the tools installed that you use, so make sure to document the tools I need to run the code, how to clone the code and how to import/run the code.  Anyone from anywhere should be able to download and run your code and reproduce your results, or its not fully completed.
